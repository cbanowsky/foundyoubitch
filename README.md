# Found You Bitch

This is a work in progress that utilizes emailhunter.co API to hunt down emails of people you need to contact.  
I would like to give all credit to Sergey S. for the contruction of the application, and it will continue to grow
so that eventually all API calls can be made from the single app.

## Get up and running

Get your API key from [emailhunter's website](https://hunter.io) and replace the value found in `views/index.jade'

This will allow you access to email hunter's API.

Next run

`npm install`

This will install all dependencies required for the app to run.

Once that is done run `node bin/www` and open a browser to localhost:3000

Enter in the information and hunt an email down.


### Next Steps

- Styling will be improved upon greatly.  This is just my starting point.
- Integration with all API calls offered by [Hunter](https://hunter.io).
- Integration with Firebase to store emails gathered by the system
- More that I am not thinking about.
